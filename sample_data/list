A world-class chemical concern, Arkema combines three strategically related, integrated businesses: Vinyl Products, Industrial Chemicals and Performance Products. With operations in more than 40 countries and 17,000 employees, the company reported revenue of €5.7 billion. Leveraging six research centers in France, the United States and Japan and internationally recognized brands, Arkema holds leadership positions in each of its principal markets. Arkema, Inc. manufactures Kynar® film and Kynar® polymer for use in the protection of photovoltaic modules. Kynar® film provides the longest-term protection available for PV modules and when used in the construction of PV back sheets provides for the permanent UV and weathering protection of the underlying PET dielectric layer. PET alone will not provide enough resistance to UV and weathering and has poor hydrolysis resistance. Kynar® film is also used for front sheet protection of solar modules and is completely resistant to UV degradation, will not chalk or yellow, has excellent dirt shedding properties and resistance to environmental pollutants. Kynar® film is also very tough and has excellent mechanical properties and cut through resistance. Kynar® PVDF polymer has been used for over 40 years in the architectural coatings market and is well recognized as the worlds most weather resistant coatings polymer (Kynar® 500). This same excellent weathering performance is seen with Kynar® film in front sheet and back sheet applications of photovoltaic modules. Protect your investment, by using Kynar® film.
